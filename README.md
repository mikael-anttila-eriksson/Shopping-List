# Shopping List
Assignment June, 2021 on Malmö University

In an earlier UX design course I developed a design for a shopping list application (app). I even made a digital sketch in Figma: https://www.figma.com/proto/WFHOvOqfEfA65OBgLDBH4E/First-TryOut-Going-Greate-o-Cl?node-id=129%3A261&scaling=min-zoom

The app was designed for two kinds of “people”, those that want to plan their shopping list before going to the store and those that aren´t really planning by with the app can make a quick plan as they go.
Here I had the chance to develop a functional version of this program. Where my main goal would be to write code for the basic functionalities.

The app works as I intended, although a user would need some instructions to use this application.
